# High-Performance Intake Manifold Design &amp; Engine Simulation

This project involves the design and simulation of a high-performance intake manifold for an FSAE event. The aim is to enhance engine performance by optimizing the intake system components, including the restrictor and plenum. The design and analysis are conducted using Lotus Engine Simulation software.

# Project Components:
* 3D CAD Model: A detailed 3D CAD model of the intake manifold designed for optimal performance.
* Simulation Files: Results from simulations performed using Lotus Engine Simulation software.
* Performance Analysis: Includes torque and power measurements at different RPM.

# Achievements:
* Optimization: Enhanced design parameters for improved low RPM efficiency.
* Torque Improvement: Increased by 20.6% from 34 Nm to 41 Nm at 4000 RPM.
* Power Improvement: Increased by 7.0% from 43 kW to 46 kW at 4000 RPM.
